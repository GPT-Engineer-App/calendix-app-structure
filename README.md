Set up Supabase backend:

Sign up for a Supabase account and create a new project.
Set up the necessary database tables for users, events, important dates, and user lifestyle data using Supabase's web interface or SQL editor.

users table: Fields for user ID, name, email, password (hashed), and lifestyle details.
events table: Fields for event ID, user ID (foreign key), title, date, time, and description.
important_dates table: Fields for date ID, user ID (foreign key), date, and description.


Configure the authentication settings in Supabase to enable OAuth authentication with the desired providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Obtain the Supabase project URL and API key for integration.


Implement authentication using Supabase OAuth:

Install the Supabase JavaScript client library in your project:
Copynpm install @supabase/supabase-js

Create an authentication service (SupabaseAuthService) in the services folder to handle Supabase OAuth integration.
Implement login and logout functionality using Supabase's OAuth authentication methods.
Store user authentication tokens securely using Supabase's built-in session management.


Develop the backend controllers and models:

Create controller functions in the controllers folder for handling business logic.

UserController:

register: Create a new user account with the provided details.
login: Authenticate user credentials and generate an access token.
updateLifestyle: Update the user's lifestyle details.


EventController:

createEvent: Create a new event with the provided details.
getEvents: Retrieve a list of events for the authenticated user.
updateEvent: Update an existing event.
deleteEvent: Delete an event.


ImportantDateController:

createImportantDate: Create a new important date with the provided details.
getImportantDates: Retrieve a list of important dates for the authenticated user.

Implement CRUD operations in the controllers for interacting with the data models using Supabase's realtime database API.


Integrate with Google Calendar:

Use the Google Calendar API or a library like react-google-calendar-api to integrate with Google Calendar.
Create a GoogleCalendarService in the services folder to handle calendar-related operations.

getEvents: Fetch the user's calendar events from Google Calendar.
createEvent: Create a new event in the user's Google Calendar.
updateEvent: Update an existing event in the user's Google Calendar.
deleteEvent: Delete an event from the user's Google Calendar.

Fetch the user's calendar events from Google Calendar and store them in Supabase's database.


Implement notifications and reminders:

Utilize Supabase's real-time subscriptions or database triggers to send notifications and reminders.
Create a notification service (NotificationService) in the services folder to handle sending notifications and reminders.

sendEmailNotification: Send an email notification using a third-party email service provider.
sendPushNotification: Send a push notification to the user's device.


Integrate with a notification service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) for sending email notifications.
Trigger notifications for upcoming events, important dates, and reminders based on the user's preferences stored in Supabase's database.
Allow users to customize their notification preferences using the Select and Checkbox components from Daisy UI.



This detailed plan covers the development of the CalendIX application using the specified technology stack (Vite, React, Daisy UI, JavaScript) and integrating with Supabase for authentication and backend. The frontend components are structured based on the provided storyboards and utilize various Daisy UI components for a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
The backend controllers handle the business logic and interact with the data models using Supabase's realtime database API. Integration with Google Calendar is included to allow users to import and sync their calendar events.
Notifications and reminders are implemented using Supabase's real-time subscriptions or database triggers, and a third-party email service provider is used for sending email notifications.
Remember to handle error scenarios gracefully, implement loading states, and ensure a smooth user experience throughout the application. Additionally, make sure to follow security best practices and protect sensitive user data.
